# Iris-Flower-Classification
Machine learning code for classifying Iris flowers based on their unique measurements. 
Dataset includes Setosa, Versicolor, and Virginica species. 
Goal is to predict an accurate classification model for categorizing Iris flowers by measurements.
# Overview
This project classifies Iris flowers based on their measurements. 
The dataset contains three species: Setosa, Versicolor, and Virginica. The goal is to build a classification model using machine learning.

# Visualizations

**Correlation Heatmap:** Explore feature relationships.
**Categorical Heatmap:** Compare feature means by species.
**Pair Plot:** Visualize feature pairs colored by species.
**Scatterplot:** Understand the relationship between "Petal.Length" and "Sepal.Width."

# Model Training
* Logistic Regression
* Decision Tree Classifier
* Each model is trained using the Iris flower dataset and evaluated for its accuracy

# Testing

After training the models, a new test dataset is used to assess their performance.
The test dataset contains measurements of Iris flowers with unknown species. 
The trained models predict the species of these flowers, and their accuracy is evaluated.
